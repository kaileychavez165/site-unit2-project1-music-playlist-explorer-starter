### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Overall, I would say I felt somewhat prepared to complete this assignment. I was comfortable with the HTML and CSS, however, I did struggle with using JavaScript. This was 
my first time using JavaScript to complete a project, so I would say it was definitely challenging, even after the lessons provided.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have loved to have implemented some of the stretch features, like removing and adding playlists. With more time, I think I would have been able to have gotten
them done. In regards to doing something differently, I think I could have started the project a bit earlier, and I should have focused more on functionality (JavaScript) rather
than CSS, which is really time-consuming; I know now that I should probably prioritize completing the more challenging aspects of a project before working on the simpler features.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My project demo went really well! It opened up room for conversation on how I could get started on the "Featured Playlist" page, which is something i really appreciated; after the
demo, my peer Chris offered guidance regarding this feature, and I'm so grateful he did! I also received positive feedback regarding my styling, which I appreciated because it is
something I'm proud about.
